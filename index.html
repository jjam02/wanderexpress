                        Hello viewers of the blog. I am a travel enthusiast and love to use points and miles
                        to travel around the world for cheap. I am currently working in a standard job so 
                        I don't have as much time to travel as some of the other bloggers out there. But as
                        an engineer by trade, I hope to bring logical analysis to find the best value for 
                        your points and miles.
