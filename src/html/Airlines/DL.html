                <h2>Domestic Economy Sweet Spots for Miles Within the United States</h2>

                <p> 
                    Welcome to my first blog! The number one thing people ask me on how to use miles 
                    is how they can travel to see family within the United States. This guide will 
                    be specifically for economy, to get from point A to point B the cheapest.
                    So grab onto your hats because we have some delving to do.
                </p> 
                <h3>Best Value Programs</h3> 
                <h4>Alaska Airlines</h4> 
                <p> 
                    The best sweet spot hands down within short to medium distances is Alaska Airlines
                    Mileage Plan. Mileage plan has the best short distance award chart PERIOD.

                <p> 
                    Between 0-1400 miles, Alaska Airlines clock in at or less than 7,500 miles. For
                    their own metal, their taxes and fees comes in at the $5.60 the TSA charges per 
                    passenger. If miles are set equal to 1 cent per point, this means that for flights 
                    up to 700 miles, they cost <b>$50.60</b> one way. Between 701 and 1400 miles, it will be <b>$80.60</b>
                    one way. In a lot of cases, this will represent fantastic value, even comparable 
                    to budget airline flights. What's more, Alaska Airlines doesn't charge a change fees
                    when changing or cancelling award tickets on their own metal.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, you might be thinking, "Hey, I don't live on the west coast so I don't fly on
                    Alaska Airlines." The good news is that Alaska Airlines is a part of the Oneworld Alliance, meaning
                    that they are able to book American Airline flights. 
                    This is a fantastic deal, even with the partner award fee for American Airlines
                    coming in at $12.50. Doing the same calculations, the flights under 700 miles comes to 
                    <b>$57.50</b> and flights between 701 and 1400 miles cost <b>$87.50</b>. Unfortunately, 
                    the partner booking fee is unrefundable if you do decide to change your ticket.
                </p> 

                <h4>Turkish</h4> 
                <p> 
                    The next up is a Star Alliance power house, Turkish Airlines. Despite getting devalued
                    earlier this year, the award chart within the United States still pose a great value. 
                    <br>
                </p>

                    Any award within the United States cost 10,000 miles plus $5.60 in TSA fees. By in the United
                    States, I mean <b>IN</b> the United States. This means from East coast to Hawaii and Alaska
                    all for the cost of 10,000 miles and $5.60. Now, again, you might be thinking, well Turkish Airlines
                    doesn't fly within the United States. Fortunately, United Airlines do. These awards apply to United
                    Airlines. When calculating total cost with 1 cent equal to 1 mile, this comes up to $105.6 one way.
                    Name a time you could fly from New York to Hawaii for this price. I can't think of one. 
                    <br><br>
                    Now,a cautionary tale. United has been real stingy with award availability to partners recently
                    so it may be harder and harder to find seats. Turkish Airlines also doesn't have the best award change
                    policies or customer service so proceed with caution.
