                        Welcome to my first blog! The number one thing people ask me on how to use miles 
                        is how they can travel to see family within the United States. This guide will 
                        be specifically for economy, to get from point A to point B the cheapest.
                        So grab onto your hats because we have some delving to do.

                        Hello viewers of the blog. I am a travel enthusiast and love to use points and miles
                        to travel around the world for cheap. I am currently working in a standard job so 
                        I don't have as much time to travel as some of the other bloggers out there. But as
                        an engineer by trade, I hope to bring logical analysis to find the best value for 
                        your points and miles.
